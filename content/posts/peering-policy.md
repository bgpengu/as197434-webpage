Peering with us is a good way to reduce latency and bandwidth as you're directly connected to us and donâ€™t need to rely on your upstream provider. If you decide to peer with **AS197434** you have to follow some basic rules, but don't worry, they aren't hard (only a security measure) ðŸ˜‰

### Requirements and Rules
+ In the possession of a RIPE assigned ASN and IPv6 prefix
+ Have a valid and up to date [PeeringDB profile](https://www.peeringdb.com/)
+ Don't **under any circumstances** point static or default routes towards us
+ A valid RPKI would be useful for validation

### Connections and Profile
