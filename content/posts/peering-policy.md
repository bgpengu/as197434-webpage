So you decided to peer with **AS197434**? We want to do the process as seamless as possible, but in order to do achieve this you have to follow some basic rules. Don't worry, they aren't that hard (only a security measure) ðŸ˜‰ *Pssst: It also increases the peer count...*


### Requirements / Rules
+ In the possession of a RIPE assigned ASN and IPv6 prefix
+ Have a valid and up to date [PeeringDB profile](https://www.peeringdb.com/)
+ Don't **under any circumstances** point static or default routes towards us
+ RPKI for validation would be useful, but RIR is **required**
+ A valid RPKI would be useful for validation, valid RIR Entries are **required**
