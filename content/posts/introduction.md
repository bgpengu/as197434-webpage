**ASN19434** is a personal ASN which was established by me in August 1, 2023 with help from [Cloudie](https://cloudie.sh/) and his partner [Zappie Host LLC](https://zappiehost.com) 🌐

The main reason started this journey was due some *interesting* routing decisions that some providers took...
Being independet and having his own control is awesome but comes with great responsibility, it's quite complicated to learn all these things.
The network is dedicated for education and learning purpose and is sometimes used in combination with my own services!

If you need some help or sponsored ressources, feel free to ask for it. IPv6 doesn't come with a price and there's enough space for everyone on this *beautiful* planet 🌍
